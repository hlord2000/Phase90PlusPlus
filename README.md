# This is a modified and extended Phase90 pedal, intended to fit into a [1590BB enclosure](https://lovemyswitches.com/1590bb-enclosure-bare-aluminum-powder-coat/). Enjoy.

## Interesting features
This pedal uses a software-controlled LFO [(StompLFO, a PIC microcontroller programmed by ElectricDruid)](https://electricdruid.net/product/stomplfo/) to generate a cool bunch of waveforms. The specific waveform is controlled with a potentiometer. An op-amp mixer is included on the output of the pedal, too, so that a musician can alter the mix of wet/dry tone. Finally, the traditional frequency potentiometer is included. This is a true bypass pedal.
